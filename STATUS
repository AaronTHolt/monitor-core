    <Comments prefixed with user id of comment author>

  * Ganglia Web Frontend conflicting license for Templating class

    bnicholes: I don't consider this to be a showstopper since it is not a regression
      from previously released versions of Ganglia. We should get this fixed in order
      to resolve any licensing conflicts in the web front end, but the affects are
      no worse than any previously released code.

  * Use the lastheardfrom timestamp from the value packet rather than the metadata packet 
     to calculate the time offset for the metric.  We are more interested in the last 
     value we got rather than the last time the metadata was received.

  * Move all gexec structs from lib/ganglia_priv.h to include/ganglia_gexec.h, this header file
     will also be included in the ganglia-devel RPM package.  This change is needed so that future
     versions of gexec can be built against ganglia 3.1.x.
