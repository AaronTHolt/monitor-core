CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:
 <TEMPLATE>
  * <Brief description of showstopper bug>
    <http:// link to email list or bugzilla bug describing the issue>
    <Comments prefixed with user id of comment author>

  * Ganglia Web Frontend conflicting license for Templating class
    http://www.mail-archive.com/ganglia-developers@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04072.html
    bnicholes: I don't consider this to be a showstopper since it is not a regression
      from previously released versions of Ganglia. We should get this fixed in order
      to resolve any licensing conflicts in the web front end, but the affects are
      no worse than any previously released code.

     enhancement: the subtitle "$metricname last $range (now $now)" is no longer clobbered and is split into
     two lines (tested with rrdtool 1.2.23)

BACKPORT PROPOSALS NEXT VERSION:
  These proposals are not targeted at the current version.  They should be
   addressed after the current version is released.

  * Allow both a C and python module to create a metric that will spoof a specific host.
     This provides the same spoofing functionality as gmetric but through a metric module.
     It is done by adding SPOOF_HOST and SPOOF_NAME as extra metadata to the metric
     description. This is patch contains fairly significant code changes so rather than
     risk destabilizing the current release, this is a proposal for a follow-on release.
