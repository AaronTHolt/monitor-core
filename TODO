General

- Add back the Ganglia logo
- Provide an easy method for user to add their organization's logo

Graphs

- Cross-rendering engine graphs using JSON ie. a single definition file that works on
  both rrdtool and graphite. Something along these lines

{
   "report_name" : "apache_report",
   "report_type" : "standard",
   "items" : [ "apache_200", "apache_300", "apache_400", "apache_500" ],
   "colors" : [ "aaaaaa", "bbbbbb", "cccccc", "dddddd" ],
   "ylegend" : "hps"
}

- Zooming 

Views

- Support regex expressions for metrics in regex views
Suggestions from Ben Hartshorne. 
- Color code by host or metric, so as to easily differentiate
- Do something else to sort by host or metric, such as all metrics from a specific host in a row
- group by metric or group by host - right now it lists all hosts metric A, then all hosts metric B (when
using the regex)

Caching

- Figure out a better way to cache metrics
- Avoid race conditions

Mobile

- Add ability to specify arbitrary time ranges
- Add support for multi-touch enlarging of graphs
- Allow hosts to be named the same in multiple clusters (right now they are filtered out)
- Add a "Home" button to quickly go back to main page
- Mobile browser detection code to automatically use mobile version
- Clicking on a metric search result should bring up the host page anchoring at the
  metric graph in question
- Add ability to add metrics to views

Graphite

- Add polish to Graphite integration
- Fix CPU report for Cluster summary. Needs to be "scaled" by number of nodes

Documentation

- Add user guide
- Add installation guide (expand on README)
- Add templating guide

New features

- Implement aggregate graphs (line and stacked)
